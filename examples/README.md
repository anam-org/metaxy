# Metaxy Examples

How to run the examples:

The [src](./src) directory provides a few examples, each being a directory, such as [recompute](./src/examples/recompute), [migration](./src/examples/migration), and [ducklake](./src/examples/ducklake).

Set `EXAMPLE` environment variable to the name of the example you want to run.

Each example walks you through a few changes in the features code to demonstrate how Metaxy handles them. Set `FEATURE` environment variable to the stage you want to observe, such as `1` or `2`.

Use Metaxy as described in the docs.
