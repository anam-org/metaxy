Metaxy is a metadata layer for **multi-modal Data and ML pipelines**. Metaxy tracks feature versions, (partial) data dependencies, and lineage across complex computation graphs.

Metaxy's goal is to provide a standard instrument for any kind of multi-modal (or just tabular) **incremental** pipelines, standardizing dependency specification, versioning, partial data dependencies, manipulations over metadata, migrations, and more.

Read the [docs](https://anam-org.github.io/metaxy) to learn more.
