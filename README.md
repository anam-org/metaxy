# 🌌 Metaxy

Metaxy is a metadata layer for multi-modal Data and ML pipelines that tracks feature versions, dependencies, and data lineage across complex computation graphs.

Metaxy's goal is to provide a pluggable instrument for any kind of multi-modal (or just tabular) **incremental** pipelines, standardizing dependency specification, versioning, partial data dependencies, manipulations over metadata, migrations, and more.
