# Metaxy + Orchestrators

Metaxy can manage feature metadata, but it's not opinionated about how and where to materialize the data itself.

This task is typically handled by an **orchestrator**.

## Dagster

Metaxy has been built with the [Dagster integration](./dagster/index.md) in mind from the very beginning.
Dagster is an excellent choice for managing Metaxy jobs.
