# Questions And Answers

!!! question "Why are feature definitions created via classes?"

    In short: it's handy for some integrations, allows to have more type annotation goodness, but isn't strictly necessary.
    We will explore other interfaces in the future (see [`anam-org/metaxy#800`](https://github.com/anam-org/metaxy/issues/800)).

!!! question "Do you support PostgreSQL?"

    Not at the moment, but we are working on it in [`anam-org/metaxy#223`](https://github.com/anam-org/metaxy/issues/223).

!!! question "What does the logo mean? Why does it look like [this](https://velvetshark.com/ai-company-logos-that-look-like-buttholes)?"

    It's an accident. I wanted it to resemble a galaxy, but it is what it is.
